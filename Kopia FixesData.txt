# Acceleration
a=F/m
F=a*m
m=F/a

#Final Speed
V=a*t
t=V/a
a=V/t

#Road
#Huuh... This will be the longest one...
#OK. Let's do it.
S=1/2*a*t^2

a=2S/t^2
t^2=2S/a

#And Vo*t +/- I will leave...

#Acceleration is Speed div Time
#This one repeats, so I removed it
#a=V/t
#V=a*t
#t=V/a

#Speed is Road div. by Time
V=S/t
S=V*t
t=S/V

#Work
W=F*s
s=W/F
F=W/s
#Little s is The Move Vector
